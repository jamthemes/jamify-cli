## Next.js support

- For Next.js, dynamically change `<body>` and `<html>` props on route changes, CSR only (very hacky fml)
  - Better: Just use React-Helmet for Next.js too

## Gatsby

- Update version in preset's package.json
- Test if everything still works

## Other

- prettify resulting page.js files
- remove all hints of statikk/jamthemes
- The compat layer should be an NPM package
- Create License
  - Allows to use converted sites for personal usage
  - Commercial use / Distribution requires license
    - When tool becomes popular, introduce some sort of watermark
  - Disallows to use this software in any commercial project, e.g. building a SaaS around it
